ðŸŽµ Dynamic Lyrics Printer


This project is a Python script that prints song lyrics dynamically, simulating the flow and rhythm of a song. Each character is displayed with a slight delay, giving the effect of a typewriter or a singer pacing their performance. It's a creative way to make text output feel alive and engaging.

ðŸš€ Features
Character-by-character printing: Each lyric is displayed gradually, mimicking a typing or singing effect.
Customizable timing: You can adjust delays between characters and lines to match your desired pace.
Realistic pauses: Adds specific delays between lines to simulate natural breaks in music or speech.


ðŸ“„ How It Works
The script uses a list of lyrics and their corresponding delays.
Each character is printed one at a time with a small delay (char_delay).
After each line, a longer pause (delays) ensures a natural rhythm.
The time.sleep() function is used to control all timing elements.


ðŸŒŸ Customization
You can easily modify the script to match your needs:

Change the lyrics: Update the lines list with your own text.
Adjust timing: Tweak the char_delay and delays values to fit different moods or paces.
Enhance visuals: Add colors or effects with libraries like colorama or rich.
